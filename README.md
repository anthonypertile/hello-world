# hello-world
This is optional
My grandfather was a programmer for MASCO back in the BASIC days so when I started college in 2014 I just assumed that I would want to become one too. However, I was lazy in taking Intro to Python and Java, not doing much beyond what was required and hardly learning. 
I'm starting this github because I want to see if I can figureout how to develop an NFC feature for an app that I use. It would be a personal challenge but I think I can make it happen by piecing together bits of code that I'll find along the way.
We'll see how it goes!
